# Built-With

The Api is built with Node.js, Json WebToken, Knex.js ORM and MySQL database to store information into the database. In addition, Json WEb Token to sign user information to accesss wallet functionality. The Application Environment Variable to implement funtionality while building the project are:


- Environment Variable Names
  - DB_HOST : to connect to  mysql url connection
  - DB_HOST : to connect to my sql host connection
  - DB_HOST : to connect to mysql  user connection
  - DB_PASSWORD : to connect to mysql  password connection
  - DB_PORT : to connect to mysql  port connection
  - DB_NAME : to connect to mysql  name connection
  - NODE_ENV : to specify the environment node connection is
  - JWT : to authenticate users
  - debug : to asychronously log statement
# Additions

This service can be intergrated in a lending application and the application can be scaled to include other funtionality
